/**
 * What a new account still has to do before Doorlink is any use to them.
 *
 * The important decision here is that **nothing is stored**. There is no
 * `onboardingStep` column, no `hasCompletedSetup` flag, no dismissed-at
 * timestamp. Every tick on this list is a query run now against the thing
 * it claims to be about: "you have posted a job" is a count of that
 * person's leads, "you have listed a part" is a count of their active
 * listings.
 *
 * A stored flag is the usual way these go wrong. It gets set optimistically
 * at the end of a wizard, the write it was meant to represent fails, and
 * the account is left with a green tick over an empty profile — the
 * checklist quietly becomes a claim nobody checked. Counting is slower and
 * it is honest, and at this scale slower does not matter.
 *
 * The consequence to keep in mind when editing: a step can go from done
 * back to not-done. Delete your last listing and the listing step unticks.
 * That is correct. The list describes the account as it is, not a path the
 * account once walked.
