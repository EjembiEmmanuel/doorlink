/**
 * Logo handling.
 *
 * The logo is stored as a data URI on the profile row rather than as an
 * uploaded file, because no file-storage backend is connected and a
 * logo is small enough that this is a reasonable permanent answer rather
 * than a stand-in. If Supabase Storage is connected later, this becomes
 * a storage key and the only caller that changes is the form.
 *
 * Everything here is validated on the server before it is written. A
 * data URI is user-supplied text that ends up inside an `<img src>` on a
 * document the buyer sends to their clients, so the type allow-list is a
 * security boundary, not a convenience: `image/svg+xml` is deliberately
 * absent, because an SVG can carry script.
